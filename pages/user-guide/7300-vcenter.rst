vSphere deployment notes
========================

.. contents :local:

:ref:`vcenter-plan` discusses actions and decisions
that should be made before attempting to deploy
Mirantis OpenStack with vSphere integration.

To deploy an OpenStack cloud that is integrated
with the vSphere environment,
click on the "New OpenStack environment" icon
to launch the wizard that creates a new OpenStack environment.

.. _vcenter-start-create-env-ug:

Create Environment and Choose Distribution for vCenter
------------------------------------------------------

Either the CentOS or Ubuntu distro
can be used as the host operating system on the Slave nodes
for environments that support integration with vSphere:

After that you need to fill corresponding fields.
You can modify the vCenter specific values on the Settings tab after you
create the environment.

Choose Backend for Cinder and Glance with vCenter
-------------------------------------------------

Ceph cannot be used as a Cinder or Glance backend;
the only choice here is to leave the default options,
which are:
- VMDK driver for Cinder.
- Swift for Glance.

.. note:: VMware vCenter managed datastore is not supported as a backend for Glance.

.. image:: /_images/user_screen_shots/vcenter-cinder.png

After you create the environment, you must enable the VMDK
driver for Cinder on the Settings tab.


- If you are using the Multi-node (no HA) mode,
  local storage is used as the backend for Glance.

Related projects for vCenter
----------------------------

Nova-network does not support Murano,
so you cannot run Murano in the OpenStack environment
with vSphere integration.

   to collect metrics from vCenter virtual resources.
